# Ansible Collections - A Primer

Ansible content collections, often called collections, are a way to add content not included in Ansible core. Roles, playbooks, modules, and plugins can be included in a collection, allowing bundling of similar content together.

<!-- more -->
Collections first appeared in Ansible 2.8 as a technical preview. Ansible 2.10 moved most modules from the main Ansible repository to separate collections repositories.
Because of this, collection updates no longer depend on the release schedule of Ansible itself and can be released more frequently if needed. This separation allows for faster bug fixes and updates.

Although there are several ways to manage collections, this article focuses on installing and using Ansible collections from the command line.

## A variable that is useful to know

Before we dive into installing and using collections, let's take a moment and look at the `COLLECTIONS_PATHS` environment variable.
This variable is a list of paths that Ansible uses to locate installed collections on the system.

!!! NOTE
    Ansible will search for a collections folder in the directory in which a playbook runs, regardless of `COLLECTION_PATHS`.

Here are two ways to see this variable's value:

```text hl_lines="2 8"
$ ansible-config dump | grep COLLECTIONS_PATHS
COLLECTIONS_PATHS(default) = ['/home/pbytes/.ansible/collections', '/usr/share/ansible/collections']
$ ansible --version
ansible [core 2.13.2]
  config file = None
  configured module search path = ['/home/pbytes/.ansible/plugins/modules', '/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /home/pbytes/Projects/ansible/venv/lib/python3.9/site-packages/ansible
  ansible collection location = /home/pbytes/.ansible/collections:/usr/share/ansible/collections
  executable location = /home/pbytes/Projects/ansible/venv/bin/ansible
  python version = 3.9.2 (default, Feb 28 2021, 17:03:44) [GCC 10.2.1 20210110]
  jinja version = 3.1.2
  libyaml = True
$
```

The `ansible-config dump` command shows the defaults for `COLLECTIONS_PATHS` as a list of two directories.
Similarly, the `ansible --version` command shows the same list but refers to it as _ansible collection location_ and doesn't indicate if it is set to defaults.

We can modify this list in our `ansible.cfg`. Under the `[defaults]` section, let's add the key _collections_paths_ and change one of the paths.
We'll keep the home directory path and replace the `/usr/share...` path `/opt/ansible/collections`.

```bash
$ cat ansible.cfg
```

```ini
[defaults]
inventory=/etc/ansible/hosts
collections_paths=~/.ansible/collections:/opt/ansible/collections
```

Let's run the `ansible-config dump` command again.

```bash
$ ansible-config dump | grep COLLECTIONS_PATHS
COLLECTIONS_PATHS(/home/pbytes/Projects/ansible/ansible.cfg) = ['/home/pbytes/.ansible/collections', '/opt/ansible/collections']
```

Notice `ansible-config dump` shows which `ansible.cfg` is setting these new values, just like it showed it was using defaults before.

With the paths configured, let's check if there are any collections in those paths.
We do this by using `ansible-galaxy collection list`.

```bash
$ ansible-galaxy collection list
$
```

The `ansible-galaxy collection list` command found no collections in the defined paths, so the command returns no output.
Depending on how you installed Ansible on your system, this might have a long list of collections that your package manager included during the Ansible install.

!!! NOTE
    There is a bug that might return the following error:

    **`ERROR! - None of the provided paths were usable. Please specify a valid path with --collections-path`**
    This error also means you have no collections in your defined paths, so you can safely ignore the error.
    For more on the error, see - https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/73127

### Installing collections
You install a collection using the format `ansible-galaxy collection install <collection.name>`.

```bashsession
$ ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.windows
Starting galaxy collection install process
Process install dependency map
Starting collection install process
Downloading https://galaxy.ansible.com/download/ansible-windows-1.11.0.tar.gz to /home/pbytes/.ansible/tmp/ansible-local-37420dwgkpdj/tmpqwyitqni/ansible-windows-1.11.0-6w0zvtsa
Installing 'ansible.windows:1.11.0' to '/home/pbytes/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections/ansible/windows'
ansible.windows:1.11.0 was installed successfully
$
```

Here we installed the _ansible.windows_ collection.
The ansible-galaxy command installs it to the first path listed in _COLLECTIONS_PATHS_, in our case:

`/home/pbytes/.ansible/collections/`

*Some options you can pass to the install command*

- -p "path": Path to install the collection
- -r "file": Install collections based on a requirements file (see below)


Let's look at an example of a requirements.yml file:

```bashsession
$ cat requirements.yml
```

```yaml
---
collections:
# Can be a list of collections names
- ansible.posix

 # Or Can be a list with name, version(opttional), and source(optional)
- name: ansible.netcommon
  version: 2.6.1
  source: https://galaxy.ansible.com
```

Using this requirements file and the -p option let's install those collections.
We will install it in the directory we run our playbooks from in the collections folder.
As noted before, even though this isn't in our _COLLECTIONS_PATHS_, Ansible will still look there.

```bash
$ ansible-galaxy collection install -r collections/requirements.yml -p ./collections
Starting galaxy collection install process
[WARNING]: The specified collections path
'/home/pbytes/Projects/ansible/collections' is not part of the configured
Ansible collections paths
'/home/pbytes/.ansible/collections:/opt/ansible/collections'. The installed
collection won't be picked up in an Ansible run.
Process install dependency map
Starting collection install process

Installing 'community.general:5.4.0' to '/home/pbytes/Projects/ansible/collections/ansible_collections/community/general'

$
```

This pulls in dependencies in addition to our requested collections. Notice that it warns us that this path is not in our current collection path.
We will revisit this in a moment, but let's look at what collections Ansible thinks are on our system.


```
$ ansible-galaxy collection list

# /home/pbytes/.ansible/collections/ansible_collections
Collection        Version
----------------- -------
ansible.windows   1.11.0
$
```

It only shows the `ansible.windows`collection we initially installed. Letâ€™s look at using collections and see if we can clear up the above warning and how even though those collections are not currently listed in our path, Ansible will still find them.

### Using collections
Here is a simple playbook that uses the dig lookup plugin in the `community.general` collection.

```bashsession
cat dig_example.yml
```


```yaml
---
- hosts: localhost
  connection: local
  tasks:
    - name: Print out
      ansible.builtin.debug:
        msg: "{{ lookup('community.general.dig', 'google.com') }}"
```

When referring to an item in a collection, we should specify the fully qualified collection name (FQCN), more on this later.
We use two collections in this playbook.
One is the `community.general` we installed from before.
The other `ansible.builtin` comes included with Ansible core. There are still some modules that are built in. Check out the Ansible docs to see more.

Now let's run it.

```bashsession
ansible-playbook dig_example.yml
```
```bash
PLAY [localhost] ***************************************************************

TASK [Gathering Facts] *********************************************************
ok: [localhost]

TASK [Print out] ***************************************************************
ok: [localhost] => {
    "msg": "142.250.72.174"
}

PLAY RECAP *********************************************************************
localhost                  : ok=2    changed=0    unreachable=0    failed=0    skipped=0    rescued=0    ignored=0
```

To clarify where we are, here is the current file structure of the folder where we ran the playbook.

```bash
$ tree -L 3
.
|-- ansible.cfg
|-- collections
|   `-- ansible_collections
|       |-- ansible
|       |-- ansible.netcommon-2.6.1.info
|       |-- ansible.posix-1.4.0.info
|       |-- ansible.utils-2.6.1.info
|       |-- community
|       `-- community.general-5.4.0.info
|-- dig_example.yml
|-- inventory
|-- requirements.yml
```

!!! TIP "Best Practice: Use Fully Qualified Collection Names"
    It is possible to type the module's name without the Fully Qualified Collection Name (FQCN). However, because different collections could have modules with the same name, it is recommended to always use the FQCN in your Ansible code. The FQCN is required for all plugins and lookups from collections except `ansible.builtin`.

With the information in this article, you should have a solid foundation for installing and using collections. Start exploring the collections available on Ansible Galaxy to see what other collections are out there.
