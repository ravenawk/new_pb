# About

Hey there!

I'm Pat - Husband, Father, and perpetual tinkerer working in tech. This site is where I document what I learn, share solutions to problems I've encountered, and occasionally save future-me from having to figure something out twice. Most of my experiments happen in my homelab, where I break things, fix them, and sometimes even improve them.

## What I Do

By day, I work as a consulting architect, helping organizations automate their infrastructure and streamline their operations. By night (and weekends), I'm usually knee-deep in my homelab, testing new tools, setting up services I probably don't need, and learning things the hard way.

## Why I Write

We've all been there - you solve a tricky problem, feel pretty clever about it, then six months later you're staring at the same issue wondering how you fixed it before. This site is my attempt to break that cycle. Writing things down helps me think through problems more clearly, and if it helps someone else avoid a few hours of debugging, even better.

## What You'll Find Here

Most of my content focuses on practical infrastructure automation, homelab adventures, and the occasional deep dive into tools I find genuinely useful. I write from a RHEL/Fedora perspective (though I dabble in Ubuntu/Debian), have strong opinions about YAML formatting, and believe documentation should be as reliable as the systems it describes.

Expect:
- Real solutions to real problems I've actually encountered
- Honest takes on tools and technologies - including when they don't work as advertised
- Step-by-step guides that include the gotchas and edge cases
- The occasional rant about why certain things in tech are unnecessarily complicated

## Beyond Tech

When I'm not breaking things in the lab or helping clients automate theirs, I'm probably:
- Trying to explain why dad needs "just five more minutes" to finish this one thing
- Finding new ways to justify homelab purchases as "learning investments"
- Reading way too much about technologies I'll probably never actually use

## Get In Touch

Found something useful? Spotted an error? Have a better way to solve something I wrote about? I'd love to hear from you. The best part of writing in public is learning from the community.

You can reach me through any of the social links at the bottom of the page, or just start a discussion in the comments if I've enabled them on a particular post.
