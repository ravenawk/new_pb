# Get in Touch

The best way to reach me is via email: [your-email@domain.com](mailto:your-email@domain.com)

If you spot an error in a guide, have a question about something I've written, or just want to share your own homelab adventures, I'd love to hear from you.

*I try to respond within a few days, but sometimes the homelab demands immediate attention. ðŸ˜‰*
