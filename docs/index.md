# Welcome to Pat's Bytes

Welcome to my corner of the internet where I document tech experiments, share hard-won solutions, and try to save my future self some headaches. Grab a coffee and dive in.

## What You'll Find Here

This isn't a blog trying to cover everything - it's a focused collection of real-world guides and solutions I've actually implemented.
Most content comes from my homelab adventures and production challenges I've wrestled with.

### Current Focus Areas

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-ansible: **[Ansible Automation](ansible/index.md)**
  Ansible with Execution Environments, Navigator, and Collections

- :material-server: **[Infrastructure Tools](infrastructure/index.md)**
  Packer, Terraform, Podman, and other tools

- :material-home-assistant: **Homelab Chronicles** *(Coming Soon)*
  Proxmox VE, self-hosted services, and lessons learned from breaking things at home

</div>

## Why This Site Exists

We've all been there - you solve a complex problem or setup up a new service, write zero documentation, and six months later you're googling the same issue again. This site is my anti-pattern to that cycle. It's equal parts:

- **Learning in public** - Writing helps me understand things deeply
- **Personal reference** - My searchable second brain for technical solutions
- **Giving back** - Maybe my 3am debugging session saves someone else's evening

## Recent Updates

!!! tip "New Ansible Navigator Guide"
    Just published a deep dive into Ansible Navigator and how it replaces traditional ansible-playbook workflows. If you're still using `ansible-playbook` directly, [check it out](ansible/navigator.md).

## Before You Dive In

Fair warning: I write from a RHEL/Fedora (sometimes Debian) perspective, automate against Proxmox VE, and have opinions about YAML indentation. Your mileage may vary, but the patterns should translate to your environment.

If you spot errors, have questions, or want to share a better approach - please reach out. The best part of learning in public is learning from others.
